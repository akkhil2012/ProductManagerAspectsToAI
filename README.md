# Data Pipeline Modernization PRD

### TL;DR

Our current data pipeline is fragmented, slow, and difficult to trust, making it hard for business and engineering teams to access reliable information quickly. The Data Pipeline Modernization project aims to deliver a robust, cloud-ready, and automated 6-stage data pipeline, improving data integrity, lowering latency, and enabling self-service analytics. The primary audience includes data engineers, analysts, business intelligence, and operational teams.

**Core Experience**

* **Step 1:** Log into the self-serve data portal or connect via API token.

  * Provide clear login prompt, support for SSO, display status of active pipelines.

* **Step 2:** Register a new data source using a guided form.

  * Capture authentication, schema, scheduling preferences.

  * Validate credentials and schema, provide actionable feedback on errors.

  * Confirmation and transparent status on ingestion job initialization.

* **Step 3:** Monitor ingestion and transformation jobs in real-time.

  * Display dashboard with job statuses, data flow health, latencies.

  * Errors and warnings surfaced via alerts and dashboards.

* **Step 4:** Access processed and validated datasets.

  * Browse datasets, export results, or run ad hoc queries.

  * Immediate indication if data is up-to-date, delayed, or under investigation.

* **Step 5:** Troubleshoot and respond to alerts.

  * Access error logs, drill into failures, execute recommended remediation steps.

* **Step 6:** Review pipeline audit and compliance logs as required.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

* Power users can trigger reprocessing, roll back changes, or initiate manual overrides.

* Graceful handling of schema drift, source outages, or intermittent connectivity.

* Automated fallback and retry logic for transient errors.

**UI/UX Highlights**

* Intuitive dashboard summarizing pipeline health and data availability.

* Responsive design for desktop and tablet; accessible color palette.

* Inline tooltips, quick actions, and contextual documentation.

* Real-time notifications via email and/or in-app.

## Narrative

Before modernization, teams struggled with slow, unreliable data flow across fragmented systems. Business analysts waited hours for reports due to inconsistent refresh schedules, and data engineers were overwhelmed by frequent, opaque pipeline breakages. There was little traceability, making root-cause analysis a painful, manual process.

With the new data pipeline, the journey is transformed: Onboarding a new CRM data source takes just minutes using a self-serve form. Data is automatically validated, errors surface instantly via the unified dashboard, and data stewards receive proactive alerts on any delays or data integrity issues. Now, analysts build near-real-time dashboards with total confidence in the numbers—helping the business respond faster to changing market conditions. Instead of firefighting, data engineers focus on scaling improvements, and operational leaders have continuous, reliable visibility into flows.

Ultimately, the business unlocks value faster and spends less time worrying about data quality—driving smarter, data-led decisions.
